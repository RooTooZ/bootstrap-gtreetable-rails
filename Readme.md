Rails 3.1 asset-pipeline gem to provide underscore.js

# Setup

Have in your Gemfile:

	gem 'bootstrap-gtreetable-rails'

And, have in your application.js manifest:

	//= require bootstrap-gtreetable

(also directly available under `/assets/bootstrap-gtreetable.js`)

And, add in your application.css
 *= require bootstrap-gtreetable

Easy as pie.
